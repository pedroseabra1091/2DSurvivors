# 2D Survivors

This repo covers many aspects of creating a survivors style game including:
  - Auto-attacking abilities;
  - Hordes of enemies that increase in difficulty over time;
  - Roguelike ability and player upgrades;
  - Permanent progression with saving and loading;
  - Levelling up by collecting experience dropped from enemies;

## Misc
> [!TIP]
> Godot VCS support is very lackluster. `.gitgnore` and other git related files are all created and managed via terminal.
